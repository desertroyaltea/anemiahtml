<p class="mb-3">Managing anemia often involves a partnership between medical treatment and your daily diet. The foods you eat provide the essential building blocks your body needs to produce healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin.</p>
<p class="mb-3">The most critical nutrient is often iron. Iron comes in two forms: heme iron (from animal sources) and non-heme iron (from plant sources). Heme iron is more easily absorbed by your body. Excellent sources include lean red meat, poultry (like chicken and turkey), and fish (especially salmon, sardines, and tuna).</p>
<p class="mb-3">Non-heme iron is still incredibly valuable, though it's absorbed less efficiently. You can find it in a wide variety of foods. Eat iron-rich foods like lentils, beans (like chickpeas and kidney beans), tofu, spinach, kale, and fortified foods like cereals and breads. To get the most out of these, you need a helper.</p>
<p class="mb-3">This is where vitamin C comes in. Pair your iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources for better absorption, especially non-heme iron. Vitamin C can significantly boost your body's ability to absorb it. Good pairings include having a spinach salad with strawberries or bell peppers, adding lentils to a tomato-based soup, or drinking a small glass of orange juice with your fortified cereal.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Iron isn't the only nutrient that matters. Your body also needs folate (Vitamin B9) and Vitamin B12 to produce functional red blood cells. A deficiency in either can lead to anemia, even if your iron levels are normal.</p>
<p class="mb-3">You can find folate in dark leafy greens (like spinach and kale again), asparagus, brussels sprouts, lentils, and avocados. Vitamin B12 is found almost exclusively in animal products: meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. If you follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, it is essential to consume foods fortified with B12 (like nutritional yeast or plant milks) or talk to your doctor about a B12 supplement.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Just as some foods help, others can hinder iron absorption. Calcium (found in dairy) and polyphenols (found in tea and coffee) can interfere with the process. You don't need to cut them out, but try to consume them separately from your main iron-rich meals. For example, instead of drinking tea *with* your lentil soup, wait an hour or two after your meal.</p>
