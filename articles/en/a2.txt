<p class="mb-3">While all types of anemia result in a low number of red blood cells, the reasons *why* this happens can be very different. Understanding the specific type you have is the first step toward the right treatment.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type worldwide. Your body needs iron to produce hemoglobin, the vital protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen. This type of anemia occurs when your body's iron stores run low. This can be caused by not getting enough iron in your diet, ongoing blood loss (such as from heavy menstrual periods or internal bleeding), or poor absorption of iron, which can happen in conditions like celiac disease.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Vitamin-deficiency anemia is another common form. Besides iron, your body needs other key nutrients to build healthy red blood cells, most notably vitamin B12 and folate (also known as vitamin B9). If your diet lacks these vitamins, or if your body is unable to absorb them properly, it can lead to anemia. A specific type called pernicious anemia occurs when the body's immune system attacks the cells that produce "intrinsic factor," a protein needed to absorb vitamin B12 from food.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Anemia of chronic disease is also very common. This type is associated with long-term health conditions that cause inflammation in the body, such as kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, or cancer. This chronic inflammation can interfere with the normal production of red blood cells. For example, in chronic kidney disease, the kidneys may not produce enough of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO), which is a crucial signal for your bone marrow to make new red blood cells.</p>
<p class="mb-3">While these are the most frequent types, other forms of anemia exist. Aplastic anemia is a rare, serious condition where the bone marrow stops producing enough new blood cells of all types. Hemolytic anemias occur when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the bone marrow can replace them, which can be due to inherited conditions (like sickle cell anemia) or autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Because the causes are so varied, the treatments must be targeted. Iron-deficiency anemia is often treated with iron supplements and dietary changes, while vitamin-deficiency anemia requires supplementing the specific vitamin that is low. Treating anemia of chronic disease focuses on managing the underlying condition.</p>
